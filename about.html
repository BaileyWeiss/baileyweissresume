  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: white;">Short Autobiography:</h2>
 </center>
 <center>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: white;">To start off, as any author would, I will start with my formal education.
  I am an Information Technology Major at Florida State University with an in major GPA of 3.893 so far.
  I have a lot of programming, cyber security, and technical experience, but my formal education isn't all that defines me.
  I'd say that the majority of my identity comes from things that I have done and learned on my own.
  To narrow down life's biggest accomplishments thus far would be to ask a child what their favorite candy is.
  Although there are many to choose from in retrospect, I’m still young and have much more to experience before I
  can say that one is better than the others. I have just merely planted all the seeds, I haven’t had enough time to watch them sprout.
  I have a book in the publishing process, I have a rather large audience on social media, I have a lifetime of experiences in all but 21 years,
  but even these I still consider seeds. I strive to surpass excellence in all aspects of life. Despite these expectations of myself,
  it doesn’t make me unrealistic. I have fairly realistic approaches to all of my goals. The book is a seed to my potential writing career.
  The large audience on social media is a seed to my potential acting career. My degree in Information Technology is a seed to my potential
  technical career, but even when/if I manage to reach those goals I will still not have reached maximum self actualization.
  There will always be areas of growth for as long as I live. There will always be knowledge that I do not obtain.
  For me, intelligence is the key to life, and the way to continuously expand my mind is through exposure and self analysis.
  One story I identify with is Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. There’s a part in the story where a machine named Deep Thought
  has to accurately answer a question. The question is, and if you’ve read the book you would already know it is ‘what is the meaning of life,
  the universe and everything?’. Many fans of the series look for meaning in the answer, which is ‘42’, but 42 is just meant to be a silly response.
  The answer has no true meaning, even Adams himself admitted it was just random, but this isn’t to say there is no meaning.
  I think the incomprehension of the answer is what has meaning. As Deep Thought mentions in the story, </h2>
 </center>
 
  <blockquote>
  [O]nce you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means.
  <span>Deep Thought (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy)</span>
</blockquote>
 
  <center>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: white;">This quote is why I identify with the story.
  The search for meaning in something you don’t understand is meaningless. It’s a paradox.
  I won’t understand the meaning of life when I don’t know what life even is.
  Despite the negative connotation, this is actually rather relieving.
  Intelligence to me isn’t knowing answers. Just knowing that the meaning of life is 42 doesn’t make me intelligent.
  Intelligence comes from the acceptance of not knowing what you can’t and growing from what you can.
